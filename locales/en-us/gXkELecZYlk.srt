00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,829
Welcome to unit 4!

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,011
Unit 4 will be a little different from previous units.

3
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:08,209
We are gonna start in right away by finishing the code for our web search engine.

4
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,145
What we have built so far is a web crawler.

5
00:00:10,145 --> 00:00:13,696
It can follow content on web pages, following links to find other pages,

6
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:16,027
but it doesn't actually respond to queries.

7
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:18,278
What we are going to build in this unit is a search engine,

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,411
where we can pass in a keyword and get a list of the pages that contain that keyword.

9
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:26,712
We are also going to learn more about how the Internet works and the World Wide Web.

10
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:32,478
The main new computer science idea in this unit is the idea of how to use and build complex data structures.

11
00:00:32,478 --> 00:00:36,178
In order to respond to queries quickly, we want to be able to have a data structure

12
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:39,640
where we can look up a keyword and quickly find the pages that match that keyword,

13
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,569
without needing to scan all pages every time.

14
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:47,176
To do this we are going to build a structure called an inverted index, or often just - an index,

15
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:52,396
that allows us to have a mapping between keywords and pages that contain these keywords.

16
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:55,694
Our index is really the same idea as an index in a book.

17
00:00:55,694 --> 00:00:58,378
I happen to have a book handy.

18
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:01,911
That is one of my favorites. I might be a little biased, since I wrote it.

19
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:07,445
But let's take a look and see if there is anything in the book that would help us understand index searching.

20
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:12,029
We could try to read the whole book, see if there is anything about indexed search in here,

21
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:18,177
or we could go to the index, and if we are lucky, the index will have what we have, it's got "indexed search".

22
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:23,061
As each keyword in the index it has the page number, so we would go to the page number where that is found,

23
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:26,662
and instead of needing to read the whole book to try to find what we are looking for,

24
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:32,912
if we can find the right page, we will find the section on indexed search right away.

25
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,345
So that's the goal of an index.

26
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,895
For our search engine what we want is an index that provides a mapping

27
00:01:37,895 --> 00:01:41,895
from keywords to list of webpages where that keyword appears.
