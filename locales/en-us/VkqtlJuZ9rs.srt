00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,759
In the previous lesson we looked at working with remote repositories.

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:07,525
Now we'll use those skills in this lesson to copy

3
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:11,130
another developer's repository and to start working on it.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,500
The skills we'll be covering in this lesson are,

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,800
being able to fork a repository,

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,205
reviewing the changes that have been made on a project by other developers,

7
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:24,744
knowing what changes to make now that you have access to the repository.

8
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:28,394
One of the tools we'll be using a lot in this lesson is git log.

9
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:31,820
I expect you to already know the basics of git log and we'll be delving

10
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:36,570
a lot more into its capabilities to narrow down the information in the repository.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,460
Sounds good? Let's check out what this whole forking thing is all about.
